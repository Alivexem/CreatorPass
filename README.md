## Overview

> Development_Began: Jan 9th, 2025.

CreatorPass is a decentralized social platform designed to empower creators and their fans through blockchain technology. Creators can mint NFT-based passes, allowing fans to access premium content, receive gifted crypto in-app, and update their wallet balance seamlessly. Itâ€™s more than just a platform, itâ€™s a gateway to deeper creator-fan connections and sustainable monetization.

Artists can now price their craft, and content creators can thrive in Web3 without relying on centralized platforms. CreatorPass is built for everyone.

While some platforms explore NFT-based access passes, such as Unlock Protocol, no other live platform is currently focused on CreatorPassâ€™s unique blend of social engagement, direct creator monetization, and Web3-native experiences.

## Why CreatorPass?


**1. Unfair Monetization & High Fees**

Traditional platforms take large cuts, and payment gateways charge high transaction fees, reducing creators' earnings.



**2. Lack of Ownership & Control**

Centralized platforms dictate content, revenue, and audience access, with no true ownership for creators or fans.



**3. Inefficient Exclusivity & Access**

Providing exclusive content is costly and fragmented, forcing fans to juggle multiple services.



**4. Limited Global & Cross-Platform Reach**

Payment and platform restrictions prevent seamless access, limiting opportunities for creators and fans worldwide due to regional restrictions from Fiat payment.

### CONCLUSION

CreatorPass was built during Reown bounty timeline, being an idea i've had for a long time, it isnâ€™t just a bounty submission. I needed a spark and hope for support, itâ€™s a blueprint for the future of content monetization around the world. With good support, this project will be scaled into a full-fledged startup, leveraging Solana and Reown AppKit for a range of Web3 features.

The goal is to onboard a new wave of users (both web2 and non-solana crypto native users) to Solana and web3 through a seamless, user-friendly platform. CreatorPass is the first of it's kind in the web3 ecosystem and an early advantage.

### The Obvious

I'll like to take account for my numerous commits to this project in a short timeline. Due to hardware limitations, my laptop struggled to build the project's Next.js server locally because of it's size. To ensure smooth development, I relied on Vercelâ€™s CI/CD pipeline for builds and debugging. After every push, Vercel automatically compiles the project, and I review the build logs to fix any errors. This approach ensured continuous progress despite local limitations. Balancing design and development within 20 days as a solo developer was no easy task, but the challenge made the entire development great.

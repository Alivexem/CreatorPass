This project commenced on **January 9, 2025.** I've had this idea all along and seeing the bounty program, i knew it was my opportunity to kickstart the project, CreatorPass highlights the potential of Web3 by leveraging Solana and Reown AppKit for seamless integration. By bringing creators and fans to the blockchain, CreatorPass is helping onboard more users to the Solana ecosystem.
